islands, they have all rested their assertions upon
conjecture, no one having ever affirmed that he
saw them, on Which account their existence has

And now ought the King, Qeen, PrinceS, and
all their dominions, as well as the whole of
Christendom, to give thanks to our Saviour jesus
Christ, who has granted us such a victory and
great success. Let processions be ordered, let
solemn festivals be celebrated, let the temples be
filled with boughs and ssovverS. Let Christ rejoice
upon earth as he does in heaven, to witness the
coming salvation of so many people heretofore
given over to perdition. Let us rejoice for the
exaltation of our saith, as well as for the augmen-
tation of our temporal prosperity, in Which not
only Spain, but all Christendom shall participate.
Such are the events which I have described to you

with brevity. Adieu.
